# About this repository

This is a GitHub repository template, which provides a consistent starting structure for new repositories.

## What this repository includes

* A [.github/](.github) folder for repository resources.
* A [docs/](docs) folder for repository documentation.
* A [project/](project) folder for [*project repositories*](#project-repositories).
* A [src/](src) folder for [*source code repositories*](#source-code-repositories).
* A `.gitignore` file.
* An `AGENTS.md` file.
* A `LICENSE` file.
* The repository's main `README.md`, which will be replaced by:
  * The [Collection-README.md](Collection-README.md) for collection-style repositories.
  * The [Project-README.md](Project-README.md) for project-style repositories.
  * The [SourceCode-README.md](SourceCode-README.md) for software or source-code repositories.

# Using the template

## Collection repositories

A ***collection repository*** is a repository that primarily collects links, notes, or documentation and **does not contain** source code.

[The Documentation Project](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/TheDocumentationProject) is an example of a collection repository.

To create a collection repository:

1. Create a new repository using this template.
2. Remove the following files/folders:
  * `src/`
  * `projects/`
  * `README.md` (this file!)
  * `SourceCode-README.md`
  * `Projects-README.md`
3. Rename `Collection-README.md` to `README.md`.
4. Modify `README.md` to reflect the content and purpose of the repository.
5. Review the files in [docs/](docs) and remove any folders/documents the new repository does not need.
6. Replace %RepositoryName% with the name of the new repository in all relevant files.
7. Add the `.do-not-commit/` folder to `.github/` (optional, but helpful)

## Project repositories

A ***project repository*** is a repository that contains multiple *projects*, which may include source code, documentation, and other assets.

The difference between a **project repository** and a **source code repository** is that a **project repository** contains projects that are loosely related - or not related at all - whereas a **source code repository** primarily focuses on a single codebase.

The [Experiments](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/Experiments) repository is an example of a project repository.

To create a project repository:

1. Create a new repository using this template.
2. Remove the following files/folders:
  * `src/`
  * `README.md` (this file!)
  * `Collection-README.md`
  * `SourceCode-README.md`
3. Rename `Projects-README.md` to `README.md`.
4. Modify `README.md` to reflect the content and purpose of the repository.
5. Review the files in [docs/](docs) and remove any folders/documents the new repository does not need.
6. Replace %RepositoryName% with the name of the new repository in all relevant files.
7. Add the `.do-not-commit/` folder to `.github/` (optional, but helpful)

Each project within the repository should have its own dedicated folder under [projects/](projects).

## Source code repositories

A ***source code repository*** is a repository that primarily contains buildable software or other source code.

To create a source code repository:

1. Create a new repository using this template.
2. Remove the following files/folders:
  * `projects/`
  * `README.md` (this file!)
  * `Collection-README.md`
  * `Projects-README.md`
3. Rename `SourceCode-README.md` to `README.md`.
4. Modify `README.md` to reflect the content and purpose of the repository.
5. Review the files in [docs/](docs) and remove any folders/documents the new repository does not need.
6. Replace %RepositoryName% with the name of the new repository in all relevant files.
7. Add the `.do-not-commit/` folder to `.github/` (optional, but helpful)

# Folder structure

Each of these folders contains a `README.md` file that provides information about the contents and purpose of the folder.

## The `./` (root) folder

```text

*Source code repositories* also include a `src/` folder to organize the source code.
